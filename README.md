# CS1110
This is the repository of code that I wrote for my first semester of programming at UVA: CS 1110. We learned to program in Java by writing a simple program before every lecture. Near the end of the course we exercised pair programming in creating a fun game called “Joust” that allowed us to be more creative in our development.
